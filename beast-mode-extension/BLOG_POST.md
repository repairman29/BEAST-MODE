## 🛡️ What Makes BEAST MODE Unique?

### Secret Interceptor - The Game Changer

**No other VS Code extension prevents you from committing secrets.**

BEAST MODE's Secret Interceptor automatically scans your staged files before every commit, blocking:
- API keys (OpenAI, GitHub, Stripe, etc.)
- Database connection strings
- JWT tokens and private keys
- Internal strategy documents
- Business-sensitive content

**Why this matters:** One accidental commit of an API key can cost your company thousands in unauthorized usage. BEAST MODE prevents this automatically.

### Architecture Enforcement

**Prevent technical debt before it happens.**

BEAST MODE enforces architecture patterns automatically:
- Blocks bad patterns as you code
- Shows inline warnings in VS Code
- Provides one-click auto-fix suggestions
- Customizable rules for your team

**Why this matters:** Technical debt accumulates silently. BEAST MODE catches violations before they become problems.

### Self-Healing System

**Your code improves automatically.**

BEAST MODE tracks code quality and provides actionable recommendations:
- Quality scores (0-100) tracked over time
- Specific suggestions to improve code
- Visual dashboard showing trends
- Historical tracking in Supabase

**Why this matters:** Manual code reviews are slow and inconsistent. BEAST MODE improves code quality automatically.

### Oracle AI Integration

**AI-powered insights about your code.**

BEAST MODE's Oracle AI provides:
- Context-aware code assistance
- Commit safety validation
- Knowledge search across codebase
- Intercepted commit analysis

**Why this matters:** AI can help, but only if it has the right context. Oracle provides that context.
