## 🎯 Objection Handling

### **Objection 1: "We already have code reviews"**
**Response:**
"Code reviews are great, but they're reactive. BEAST MODE is proactive - it catches issues before they reach review. Your reviewers can focus on architecture and logic, not syntax errors."

### **Objection 2: "It's too expensive"**
**Response:**
"Let's do the math. One bug in production costs [X] hours to fix. BEAST MODE prevents [Y] bugs per month. At $19/month, that's [ROI calculation]. Plus, you can start free and upgrade when you see value."

### **Objection 3: "We don't need the Full Suite"**
**Response:**
"GitHub App is perfect for getting started. But if you want to see quality trends over time, collaborate with your team, or integrate with your CI/CD, Full Suite is worth it. Start with GitHub App, upgrade when you're ready."

### **Objection 4: "We'll build it ourselves"**
**Response:**
"Building quality checks takes months. BEAST MODE is ready today. Plus, we're constantly improving based on feedback from thousands of developers. You'd spend more time maintaining it than using it."
