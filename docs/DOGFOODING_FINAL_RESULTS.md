## 🛠️ System Architecture

### Components
1. **ProjectAnalyzer** - Analyzes repo structure
2. **AutomatedQualityImprover** - Orchestrates improvements
3. **QualityToCodeMapper** - Maps recommendations to files
4. **CodeGenerator** - Generates project-specific code

### Data Flow
```
Repo → ProjectAnalyzer → Enhanced Context
  ↓
Quality API → Recommendations
  ↓
QualityToCodeMapper (with context) → File Actions
  ↓
CodeGenerator (with context) → Generated Files
```
