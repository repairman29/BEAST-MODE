## 📝 **TEMPLATE FOR NEW CONTENT**

When writing new marketing or documentation:

1. **Focus on what the system does:**
   - "System calculates quality scores"
   - "System provides automated fixes"
   - "System analyzes your code"

2. **Focus on what users can do:**
   - "You can see your quality score"
   - "You can apply fixes with one click"
   - "You can track progress over time"

3. **Focus on measurable outputs:**
   - "Quality score (0-100)"
   - "Issues found (count)"
   - "Fixes applied (count)"

4. **Avoid aspirational metrics:**
   - Don't claim time savings
   - Don't claim cost savings
   - Don't claim specific improvements

## ✅ **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

Before publishing any marketing or documentation:

- [ ] Can I verify this claim by using the system?
- [ ] Is this something the system actually does?
- [ ] Can users see/measure this themselves?
- [ ] Am I making assumptions about user outcomes?
- [ ] Would this claim hold up in a review?
