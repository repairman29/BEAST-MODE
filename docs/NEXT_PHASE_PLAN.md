## 🚀 Quick Wins (Can Do Today)

1. **Performance Metrics Dashboard UI** (1-2 hours)
   - Already have component, just needs page integration

2. **API Documentation** (2-3 hours)
   - Document all 18 new APIs
   - Create OpenAPI spec updates

3. **Integration Tests** (3-4 hours)
   - Test new features together
   - Verify end-to-end flows

4. **Error Handling Improvements** (2-3 hours)
   - Better error messages
   - User-friendly error pages

## 💡 Recommendation

**Start with Option 1: Polish & Production Readiness**

This ensures:
- ✅ Everything works end-to-end
- ✅ Users can actually use the features
- ✅ Production is stable and monitored
- ✅ Documentation is complete

Then move to Option 3 (Scale) as you get users, and Option 2 (Advanced Features) as competitive differentiators.
