4. **Avoid aspirational metrics** - No time/cost savings without data
5. **Verify everything** - Can users see/measure this themselves?

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

### **To Add More Provable Value:**
1. **Collect real user data** - Track actual quality score improvements
2. **Measure actual usage** - Track how many fixes are applied
3. **Gather testimonials** - Get real user stories with metrics
4. **Build case studies** - Document real improvements

### **Once We Have Data:**
- Can add "Average quality score improvement: X points" (with data)
- Can add "X issues fixed per user" (with data)
- Can add "X% of users see improvement" (with data)

**Status**: ✅ **ALL DOCUMENTATION UPDATED - ALL CLAIMS ARE PROVABLE**
