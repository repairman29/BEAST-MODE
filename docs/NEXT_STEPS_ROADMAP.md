- [ ] Expand prediction types (beyond quality)

**Month 7-8: Production Optimization**
- [ ] Model versioning and A/B testing at scale
- [ ] Advanced monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Cost optimization

**Month 9-12: Advanced Capabilities**
- [ ] Multi-modal predictions
- [ ] Advanced feature engineering
- [ ] Model explainability
- [ ] AutoML capabilities

### **8. Additional Consolidations** ⏳
- [ ] Review other service overlaps
- [ ] Consolidate remaining redundant services
- [ ] Optimize service interactions
- [ ] Reduce request complexity further

## 🎯 **PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Top 3 Priorities:**

1. **Browser Testing** (This Week)
   - Most critical - verify everything works
   - Catch any integration issues early
   - Validate the consolidation was successful

2. **Performance Testing** (This Week)
   - Ensure no regressions
   - Measure improvements
   - Optimize if needed

3. **Service Monitoring** (Next 2 Weeks)
   - Track service health
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Set up alerts
