## 🎸 Who We Are

**BEAST MODE** is an AI-powered development companion built for **vibe coders** - developers who code with passion, build with purpose, and ship with style.

We're not just another dev tool. We're a movement. A community. A vibe.

### Our Story
Built by a solo developer who got tired of corporate dev tools that felt clunky, complicated, and soulless. BEAST MODE was born from the belief that coding should be fun, tools should feel good, and quality shouldn't be optional.

- **Build with Purpose** - Every feature matters
- **Ship with Style** - Quality is the vibe
- **Community First** - We lift each other up
